# Diary Archiver

A commandline tool to archive diary from Google Keep to SQLite for easy search and maintenance. Optionally, it can leverage OpenAI to generate keywords and mood color by the diary text.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10
- pipenv

### Setup

1. Clone this repository and install packages under the created folder:

```
> pipenv install
> pipenv shell
```

2. Update the `src/common.py` to your own configuration file (file format as in sample `src/config.json`):

``` Python
# config_path = 'config.json'
config_path = '..\\..\\diary_archiver.config.json' # keep config file outside of this repo as having access key
```

3. Run archiver command under `src` to load your diaries from Google Keep. Note, the password for your Google account needs to be an App password. After it runs successfully, you can use DB Browser for SQLite to examine the data.

```
> python archiver.py
```

4. [Optional] Run enricher command under `src` to add keywords and mood color with OpenAI support. Note, you need to add your own `openai_key` in `config.json` for it to work.

```
> python enricher.py
```

5. [Optional] Run tagfix command under `src` to handle uncommon delimiters generated by OpenAI for keywords. You can configure it with `tag_delimiters` in `config.json`.

```
> python tagfix.py
```
